# Chain-of-Thought Assistant 🧠

This project is a simple **AI assistant** that works in three stages — `START`, `PLAN`, and `OUTPUT`.  
It uses the **SambaNova API** with the `Meta-Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` model to demonstrate reasoning step by step.



## 🚀 Features
- Uses `chain-of-thought` style reasoning (plan before output).
- Structured JSON responses (`{ "step": "START" | "PLAN" | "OUTPUT", "content": "..." }`).
- Colorful console output:
  - 🔥 START
  - 🧠 PLAN
  - 🤖 OUTPUT
